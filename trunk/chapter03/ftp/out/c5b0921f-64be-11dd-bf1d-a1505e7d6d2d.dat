Summary of changes from v2.6.9 to v2.6.10
============================================

<akpm@osdl.org>
	[PATCH] wireless-extension-v17-for-linus.patch
	
	From: Jean Tourrilhes <jt@bougret.hpl.hp.com>
	
		This is the patch to migrate Wireless Extension from WE-16 to
	WE-17 for kernel 2.6.X. I would like you to queue that patch and
	submit it to Linus as soon as 2.6.8 is released (so it can be fully
	tested during 2.6.9). If you want, I can resend that as soon as 2.6.8
	is released.
	
		The patch is basically unchanged compared to the version
	posted to the netdev list and my web page one month ago, I just
	re-diff to the latest kernel (2.6.8-rc2-bk12). The patch already
	included feedback from various driver maintainers, and nobody else
	complained, so I guess it's ready.
		The patch for some drivers inside the kernel will follow
	(airo.c, wavelan.c, wavelan_cs). Patch for various other drivers
	(orinoco, hostap, prism54) have been sent already to their maintainers
	(one month ago) and basically waiting for this patch.
	
		Changelog :
	 *	- Add flags to frequency -> auto/fixed
	 *	- Document (struct iw_quality *)->updated, add new flags (INVALID)
	 *	- Wireless Event capability in struct iw_range
	 *	- Add support for relative TxPower (yick !)
	 *	- Change the way we get to spy_data method for added safety and hostap
	 *	- Remove spy #ifdef, they are always on -> cleaner code
	 *	- Allow any size GET request if user specifies length > max
	 *	- Start migrating get_wireless_stats to struct iw_handler_def
	 * Based on patch from Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> :
	 *	- Fix kernel data leak to user space in private handler handling
	
		I also added on my page a version of Wireless Tools that use
	RtNetlink instead of ioctls. This is not as clean as I would like, but
	is fully functional (if you have WE-19). I know that you were
	interested, so feel free to send feedback on that...

	[PATCH] wireless-drivers-update-for-we-17.patch
	
	From: Jean Tourrilhes <jt@bougret.hpl.hp.com>
	
		This patch complement the main WE-17 patch I just sent you. It
	updates a few driver to take advantage of WE-17. You should queue it
	along with the other patch.
	
		o Aironet driver :
			o iwspy data can be shared between eth0 and wifi0 if needed
			o allow arbitrarily large scan results (no longer limited)
			o export wireless event capabilities
		o Wavelan drivers :
			o export wireless event capabilities

	[PATCH] USB: OHCI init cleanups
	
	This ought to fix the NS9750 init issue, and make the AMD756 case
	at least somewhat better.  It makes the init go "by the book" in more
	ways, and formalizes one quirk.
	
	Various OHCI init/reset cleanups for different silicion environments:
	
	 - Reset a bit more "by the book".
	
	    * Define a new quirk flag for the SiS and OPTi problem seen earlier.
	      Since 2.4 we've always worked around that quirk, even though we've
	      not seen that on other chips; but it's "wrong" and doesn't work on
	      some chips (notably NetSilicon NS9750).
	
	      The quirk still seems to be needed for SiS, but either this test
	      machine is too fast for the OPTi problem to show up, or the frame
	      timing setup problem there came from a now-fixed bug.
	
	    * Look at the HC state before resetting it; depending on whether
	      it was previously owned by BIOS, SMM, an OS, or nobody, different
	      USB signaling (and timings) might be needed.
	
	    * Re-init the frame timings right after soft reset, rather than
	      later (potentially too much later).
	
	    * Restore a reset in the PCI startup code, so this logic more closely
	      resembles the non-PCI paths (future code sharing).  It also makes it
	      easier to guarantee a 1-millisecond ceiling between reset and "go".
	
	      An earlier reset is being done to help workaround BIOS-related
	      problems on some boards, but we may need an even earlier one
	      (as a PCI quirk, before IRQs get reconfigured).
	
	 - Add an explicit #define to disable the BIOS/SMM handoff; it's
	   not just HPPA, many embedded chips don't expect BIOS either.
	
	 - There are reports of AMD 756 machines disliking the OHCI suspend
	   patch of a few months back.  Erratum #10 partly explains that, so
	   now root hubs won't autosuspend on those Slot-A era chips.
	
	 - Other minor fixes
	
	    * We've got lots of non-PCI OHCI now too, so comments shouldn't
	      be assuming all-is-pci!
	
	    * Hey, it's unsafe to call hc_reset() in IRQ (after unrecoverable
	      error); so just force a soft reset, don't do the whole thing.
	
	Tested on half a dozen different OHCI versions, but maybe some other
	versions of OHCI will be sensitive to one of these changes.

	[PATCH] USB: Remove inappropriate unusual_devs.h entry
	
	A couple of months ago you applied a patch from Torsten Scherer to create
	a new unusual_devs.h entry.  In further discussions with him I learned
	that the entry wasn't needed to access the device; the only reason for it
	was as a workaround for some old, buggy hotplug program on his system.
	
	Now Evan Fletcher reports that the entry actively prevents him from using
	his device.  For me that's the last straw, so here's a patch to remove the
	entry.  Torsten should be okay if he simply upgrades his hotplug package
	or removes the buggy program.

	[PATCH] USB: circular buffer for pl2303
	
	Here is the patch adding a circular buffer to pl2303
	updated to 2.6.9-rc1.  Phil and I both tested this.
	(Phil tested a slightly different earlier version.)
	
	This fixes the carriage return newline problem Olaf
	Hering reported and helps Phil with hotsyncing his
	phone.  This patch also fixes a problem that would
	sometimes leave a pl2303 port unable to send data,
	reporting "already writing", after closing the port
	while writing was in progress.  This happened about
	1/3 of the time in my tests with the stock 2.6.9-rc1
	pl2303 driver.
	
	
	- Added a circular write buffer, protected by the
	  existing spin lock.
	
	- Write_room and chars_in_buffer now report room and
	  chars in the circular buffer.
	
	- Added a "bounce buffer" when transfering data from
	  user space to the circular buffer--needed for locking.
	
	- Replaced (urb->status != -EINPROGRESS) with a private
	  write_urb_in_use flag protected by the existing spin
	  lock.  Clear this flag when the urb is unlinked.
	
	- Free memory on failed startup.
	
	- These changes make ONLCR mapping work and fix a bug
	  that would sometimes leave the port unable to write,
	  reporting "already writing", after closing the port
	  while writing was in progress.

	[PATCH] USB: close waits for drain in pl2303
	
	Here is an additional patch for pl2303 in 2.6.9-rc1,
	to be applied after my previous circular buffer patch.
	This patch waits for the buffer to drain on close and
	then clears the buffer.  In addition to the obvious
	features, this also fixes a bug where closing a port
	with a full buffer would accidentally disable writes
	when the port was re-opened.
	
	The original pl2303 could lose data that was still going
	out the port on close, and even this patch only solves
	the problem completely for data rates of 1200 bps and
	above.
	
	Waiting for data to drain from the circular buffer is
	easy, but the problem is waiting for data to drain from
	the 256 byte hardware buffer on the device.  I don't know
	how much data is in the hardware buffer, so I just wait
	long enough for a potentially full hardware buffer to
	drain, but I don't want to wait that long for low data
	rates if the buffer isn't full.  There is probably some
	way to query the pl2303 to find out how much data is in
	its hardware buffer, maybe snooping would reveal that.
	
	- Added a wait for data to drain from the driver
	  write buffer when closing.
	
	- Added a wait for the data to drain from the
	  device hardware buffer when closing.
	
	- Cleared the driver write buffer when closing.

	[PATCH] USB: Centralize logical disconnects in the hub driver
	
	This patch takes some code that was only used in one place in the hub
	driver, and packages it up into a subroutine which is now called from
	several places.  The routine does a logical disconnect -- for example,
	after issuing a port reset, if the device descriptors have changed
	(because of a firmware update perhaps) we logically disconnect the old
	device structure and create a new one.  Or if a resume fails for any
	reason we can do the same thing.
	
	This touches some of David Brownell's suspend/resume code, obviously.
	(It also fixes a couple of small errors in there.)  He has said it looks
	okay.

	[PATCH] prism54 Code cleanup
	
	(Patches submitted by Denis Vlasenko)
	There are neither functionality changes nor bug fixes.
	
	* 2004-08-14 Denis Vlasenko <vda@port.imtp.ilyichevsk.odessa.ua>
	* Move assignment out of if()
	* Remove trailing space from printk
	* Eliminate not needed local 'u32 reg'
	* Add a comment about undoc bits
	* Add #define VEC_SIZE, use it as appropriate
	* Add some printks to reset error code path (our

	* Some not needed NULL assignments removed

<margitsw@t-online.de>
	[PATCH] prism54 initial WPA support
	
	* Work based on initial patches from Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>
	* Initial wpa_supplicant support work:
	* isl_ioctl.c (prism54_process_trap_helper): Start to use mlmeex,
	* start doing what's right for
	* DOT11_OID_AUTHENTICATEEX,
	* DOT11_OID_ASSOCIATEEX,
	* DOT11_OID_ASSOCIATEEX, and
	* DOT11_OID_REASSOCIATEEX
	
	* isl_ioctl.c: add temporary structure for wpa_supplicant requests,
	
	* isl_ioctl.c: add prism2_ioctl_set_encryption which can probably be removed
	later
	
	* isl_ioctl.c: add prism2_ioctl_set_generic_element (well tested)
	
	* isl_ioctl.c: add prism2_ioctl_mlme which should be unnecessary since
	* WE scan should be used by wpa_supplicant
	
	* isl_ioctl.c: add prism54_hostapd - this parses wpa_supplicant
	* requests and does the right job for each
	
	* isl_ioctl.c (prism54_set_wpa): changed to not use mgt_set/mgt_commit
	* as commit is unecessary. Added proper OID sets to enable/disable WPA.
	* This is called by wpa_supplicant at startup. This should eventually
	* be part of WE18.
	
	* isl_ioctl.c (prism54_ioctl): Links wpa_supplicant to prism54
	
	* isl_ioctl.h: defined prism54_set_wpa to allow prism54_hostapd to use
	
	* isl_oid.h: add struct obj_attachment for OID OID_TYPE_ATTACH
	
	* oid_mgt.c: map OID DOT11_OID_ATTACHMENT to struct obj_attachment
	
	* oid_mgt.c (mgt_le_to_cpu, mgt_cpu_to_le): handle endianness for
	* obj_attachment
	
	* oid_mgt.c: add mgt_set_varlen, needed for mlmeex as it has a
	* variable size field.
	
	* oid_mgt.c: add mgt_unlatch_all, this can be used to force a commit
	* on OIDs:
	* MEDIUMLIMIT, BEACONPERIOD, DTIMPERIOD, ATIMWINDOW,
	* LISTENINTERVAL, FREQUENCY, EXTENDEDRATES
	* These OIDs are "latched". TODO: config mode handling.
	* oid_mgt.c (mgt_response_to_str): learn to parse OID_TYPE_ATTACH
	* oid_mgt.h: add mgt_set_varlen, and mgt_unlatch_all

	Documentation,PCI drivers,Intel8x0 driver

	bridge devices), joystick port address 0x208 isn't supported, the MIDI
	interrupt isn't detected, PnP isn't supported, changing the port
	addresses in the LPC bridge configuration doesn't affect the devices
	in the Super-I/O chip connected to the LPC bus, and registering this

	[PATCH] USB Storage: change how INQUIRY is fixed up
	
	The usb-storage driver 'fixes up' the INQUIRY data returned by a device so
	that it reads SCSI rev 2 by intercepting the data in-flight.  This was done
	to make various SCSI drivers (sd, sr, etc.) work with the device.
	
	However, this technique also has the unfortunate side-effect that nobody
	can see the real rev. -- not even sg users.
	
	This patch changes that.  Now, the SCSI revision is changed in the
	slave_configure() function.  Thus, the 'real' data is available to anyone
	who wants to issue an INQUIRY directly via any means.
	
	This also simplifies the code somewhat.

	[PATCH] I2C: Fix macro calls in chip drivers
	
	I noticed that some I2C chip drivers (all written or reviewed by me, I
	feel ashamed to say) misuse macros. Passing function calls
	(simple_strtol in this case) to macros evaluating their argument up to 4
	times is certainly not wise and obviously performs poorly. It is not
	critical in that it happens only when writing to the chips (setting
	limits), which doesn't happen that often. However I'd say it's worth
	fixing.
	
	Thus, the patch below fixes that, by moving the function calls outside
	of the macro calls.

	descriptor) to the File-Storage Gadget.  The changes were based on the
	additions made to the Gadget Zero driver.

	[PATCH] USB: Unusual_devs entry for Panasonic cameras
	
	Thanks to Tom Hughes for jogging my memory about this patch, which has
	been sitting here waiting for Greg's return.  It adds an unusual_devs.h
	entry for the Panasonic DMC-LCx line of cameras, which incorrectly report
	the total number of blocks in response to READ CAPACITY rather than the
	highest available block number.
