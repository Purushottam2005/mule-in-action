	[PATCH] r8169: add ethtool_ops.{get_regs_len/get_regs}
	
	- ethtool_ops.{get_regs_len/get_regs} for r8169;
	- fix a dubious check: datasheet v1.21 claims on p.44 that io/memory space
	  is exactly 256 bytes wide;
	- use SET_ETHTOOL_OPS().

<romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
	[PATCH] r8169: code cleanup
	
	Cleanup/code removal:
	- MAX_ETH_FRAME_SIZE is not used;
	- removal of assertion for impossible condition (if it happens, it will _not_
	  take long to notice anyway)
	- introduce rtl8169_release_board() to factor out some code;
	- rtl8169_init_board:
	  - some variables are not really needed nor do they help read the code;
	  - more explicit name for label;
	- tp->{Rx/Tx}DescArray: no need to zeroize coherent DMA mapping.

	[PATCH] r8169: default on disabling PCIDAC
	
	Default to disabling PCI DAC as this option appears unsafe on amd64
	(original suggestion by Hans-Frieder Vogt <hfvogt@arcor.de>).
	
	The driver will typically report PCI System error when something goes
	wrong. The relevant interrupt is not masked any more and the driver
	can thus be disabled.

	Sure. Patch is for 2.6 (not rediffed, yell if it doesn't apply
	anymore). Btw, did you pick up the mc_filter patch for 2.4 via-rhine?
	
	This untested patch fixes hardware mc filters for tulip_core, winbond,
	and atp. Hopefully :-).

	[PATCH] r8169: Tx timeout rework
	
	Tx timeout rework:

	[PATCH] S2io: sw bug fixes
	
	1. In free_rx_buffers clearing out RxDs not owned by Xena.
	
	2. In alarm_intr_handler, when a serr error occurs, schedule a task
	to reset the card rather than stopping Tx queue.
	
	3. In s2io_close freeing IRQ before calling s2io_reset also added a
	new call to flush queued tasks. This is not done if the s2io_close
	itself is called from a queued task like s2io_restart_nic.
	
	4. read_eeprom function has been changed such that data to be returned
	is sent as an input argument and the return value represents a
	pass/fail. The previous implementation as Randy had pointed out was
	error prone as on failure it returned -1 which can be interpreted
	as all ff's, so any data area which contained ff's in the eeprom was
	likely to be treated as an error.
	
	5. Added a flag "task_flag" to track if the call to s2io_close is
	coming from the s2io_restart_nic function or from the ifconfig <I/F>

	[PATCH] S2io: optimizations
	
	1. Definitions of LOW and PANIC levels of the Rx buffers have changed.
	
	2. In wait_for_cmd_complete there is no longer a writeq but just a
	read and wait for strobe bit to reset.
	
	3. In s2io_isr, the isr_lock has been done away with also the NICs
	interrupt are no longer disabled explicitly on entering the interrupt
	handler and re-enabled again before leaving it.
	
	4. Also clearing the semaphore "tasklet_status" when exiting
	erroneously from s2io_isr after failing fill_rx_buffer call.
	
	5. The set/reset Tx Csum function through ethtool was added to the
	ethtool_ops structure.
	
	6. Added a Rx side error code in the rx_osm_handler function.
	
	7. No longer stopping and waking Tx queue when link state changes in
	s2io_link function.
	
	8. removed the isr_lock spinlock from the s2io_nic structure.
	
	9. changed parameters which determine thresholds(LOW and PANIC)
	to replenish Rx buffers.
	   This has been found to result in better performance.

	[PATCH] S2io: hardware fixes
	
	1. Xena3's with a set of subsystem IDs had Link LED problems, fixed
	that specifically for them.
	
	2. To write into the Keyed Mac_Cfg register to enable broadcast,
	writing two 32 bit writes into it along with a write to the key
	register rather than a single write to key and a 64 bit write to
	mac_cfg. This is necessary on 32 bit systems where a writeq(64 bit
	write) is actually two writel (32 bit writes).
	
	3. Writes to some special registers mentioned in UG is being done by
	a special macro which defines which 32 bits of the 64 bit register
	is to be written first. Again this applies only on 32 bit systems.
	
	4. Configured pause frame related water marks and a shared_split
	value which describes the Max TXDMA related split transaction that
	can be used without giving room for the Rx transactions.
	
	5. The mac_rmac_err_reg R1 register will be cleared in  the interrupt
	handler itself rather than in the scheduled task as was being done
	previously.
	
	6. Even on PCC_FB_ECC error the card will be reset by disabling
	adapter enable bit.

	[PATCH] S2io: new txd allocation
	
	The attached patch contains a modified scheme for allocating Tx descriptor
	blocks.
	More description follows.
	
	In the old scheme, the entire Tx descriptor space was allocated in
	one go. This could cause driver load to fail on systems with low(or
	scattered) memory. The Tx descriptor blocks are now allocated on
	per-page basis. A new structure (list_info) has been introduced in
	nic_t structure to keep track of the physical and virtual addresses
	of every TxD allocated this way.

	3. Also introduced a new vaiable put_pos in nic_t to keep track of
	absolute position of the put pointer of Rx ring.
	
	4. When NAPI is used, fill_rx_buffer is not called from the interrupt
	handler(s2io_isr) .
	
	5. In s2io_poll, decrementing packets processed is done inside the
	while loop unlike out side it as was being done last time.

	[PATCH] S2io: two buffer mode
	
	Attached is the patch for implementing 2-buffer mode on Rx path.
	
	On certain systems when a DMA has to happen on an un-aligned memory
	location performance will take a significant hit. It's standard
	practice to offset the Rx buffer address by 2 (as Mac header is 14
	bytes) so the IP header starts from an aligned location.  Obviously
	using a single Rx buffer both cannot be achieved. Thus XFrame supports
	something called 2 buffer Rx mode, where in the Rx'ed frame is split
	into 2 parts, one is the Ethernet header and the other is the Ethernet
	payload. So now we can allocate proper aligned memory for both buffers,
	hence the DMA is not slowed down. Also, the Ethernet payload(starting
	from L3 header) is on an aligned location so OS need not have to do
	un-aligned accesses to process IP header. To achieve this, the kernel
	function eth_type_trans functionality has to be partially implemented
	in the driver itself.

	This patch addresses the comments by Chris Leech about
	skb->mac.ethernet resulting in NULL dereference with the old method
	of implementing 2 buffer mode. The new method performs a copy of the
	MAC header to the head of the payload. This is a stop-gap measure till

	[ALSA] removes unneeded spin_lock_irqsave()s from snd-es1968
	
	ES1968 driver
	spin_lock_irqsave(&chip->reg_lock) was called a second time in sequence from
	snd_es1968_bob_start() called from es1968_measure_clock().
	While this didn't cause harm on my UP laptop with mainline kernels,
	it made 'insmod snd-es1968' hang on kernel 2.6.9-mm1-RT-V0.6.9.
	The patch assumes that 2 callpaths don't need explicit spinlock protection:
	1: The trigger callback, because it is called with IRQs disabled.
	2. PM's suspend/resume callbacks, because  those are called while ortdinary
	   user processes are frozen.
	   Thus the spin_lock_irqsave(&chip->reg_lock)  calls in snd_es1968_bob_start()
	   / snd_es1968_bob_stop() are not needed.
